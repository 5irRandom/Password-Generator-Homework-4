# Password-Generator-Homework-4
Week 4's assignment is a password generator, this is where I'm putting it

This is the completed app, with all of the functionality described in the readme, you can choose the length, characters to include (via prompts unfortunately) and it will automatically generate a string of characters matching those parameters.
